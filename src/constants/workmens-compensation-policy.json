    "description": [
      "Every company must ensure a safe workplace, but accidents can still happen. Injuries or, in severe cases, death during employment require compensation under laws like the Employee’s Compensation Act 1923 (previously called as the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923). Not compensating can lead to legal issues, affecting employee confidence and the business's reputation. Employee’s compensation insurance (commonly known as WC policy or WC insurance) helps financially, covering compensation and legal costs. It also protects against lawsuits, as employees usually give up the right to sue for workplace negligence when accepting benefits. Previously known as Workmen Compensation Insurance, it ensures both businesses and employees are financially protected. ICICI Lombard’s Employee’s Compensation Insurance helps you financially safeguard your employees and their families against unfortunate workplace accidents and mishaps. Most importantly, it presents you as a thoughtful and caring employer who values his workforce, an asset for any organization."
